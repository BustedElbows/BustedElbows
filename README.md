### Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm Vladimir, still a student. 

Currently studying Electrotechnics and Telecommunication at school.
In my free time I've been studying Cybersecurity, and I've been doing it for a few years now, started around the pandemic.

I always love learning new things, techniques and expanding my knowledge base.

> Fun fact: Cybersecurity is like an Onion. There's layers, and at some point you start to cry.
